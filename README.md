## 📊 Key Insights 
 
📈 Strong Portfolio Performance

86% of loans are in good standing (fully paid or current), demonstrating effective risk assessment and portfolio health
Only 14% of loans were charged off, indicating robust credit evaluation processes

💰 Profitable Lending Operations

The bank collected $473M against $436M funded, showing positive returns on the loan portfolio
Good loans generated $436M in repayments from $370M funding, highlighting strong ROI

⚠️ Risk Management Assessment

Bad loans resulted in significant losses with only $37M recovered from $65M funded
This identifies opportunities for improved risk screening and recovery strategies

📊 Healthy Business Growth

December 2021 alone saw 4,314 new applications, indicating ongoing business expansion

🎯 Strategic Interest Rate Positioning

Average 12.05% interest rate balances profitability with borrower affordability
13.33% average DTI ratio suggests responsible lending practices
